For example, aria2.tellStatus("2089b05ecca3d829", ["gid", "status"]) returns the gid and status keys only. The response is a struct and contains following keys. Values are strings.
		 * <p>
		 * gid - GID of the download.
		 * <p>
		 * status - active for currently downloading/seeding downloads. waiting for downloads in the queue; download is not started. paused for paused downloads. error for downloads that were stopped because of error. complete for stopped and completed downloads. removed for the downloads removed by user.
		 * <p>
		 * totalLength - Total length of the download in bytes.
		 * <p>
		 * completedLength - Completed length of the download in bytes.
		 * <p>
		 * uploadLength - Uploaded length of the download in bytes.
		 * <p>
		 * bitfield - Hexadecimal representation of the download progress. The highest bit corresponds to the piece at index 0. Any set bits indicate loaded pieces, while unset bits indicate not yet loaded and/or missing pieces. Any overflow bits at the end are set to zero. When the download was not started yet, this key will not be included in the response.
		 * <p>
		 * downloadSpeed - Download speed of this download measured in bytes/sec.
		 * <p>
		 * uploadSpeed - Upload speed of this download measured in bytes/sec.
		 * <p>
		 * infoHash - InfoHash. BitTorrent only.
		 * <p>
		 * numSeeders - The number of seeders aria2 has connected to. BitTorrent only.
		 * <p>
		 * seeder - true if the local endpoint is a seeder. Otherwise false. BitTorrent only.
		 * <p>
		 * pieceLength - Piece length in bytes.
		 * <p>
		 * numPieces - The number of pieces.
		 * <p>
		 * connections - The number of peers/servers aria2 has connected to.
		 * <p>
		 * errorCode - The code of the last error for this item, if any. The value is a string. The error codes are defined in the EXIT STATUS section. This value is only available for stopped/completed downloads.
		 * <p>
		 * errorMessage - The (hopefully) human readable error message associated to errorCode.
		 * <p>
		 * followedBy - List of GIDs which are generated as the result of this download. For example, when aria2 downloads a Metalink file, it generates downloads described in the Metalink (see the --follow-metalink option). This value is useful to track auto-generated downloads. If there are no such downloads, this key will not be included in the response.
		 * <p>
		 * following - The reverse link for followedBy. A download included in followedBy has this object's GID in its following value.
		 * <p>
		 * belongsTo - GID of a parent download. Some downloads are a part of another download. For example, if a file in a Metalink has BitTorrent resources, the downloads of ".torrent" files are parts of that parent. If this download has no parent, this key will not be included in the response.
		 * <p>
		 * dir - Directory to save files.
		 * <p>
		 * files - Returns the list of files. The elements of this list are the same structs used in aria2.getFiles() method.
		 * <p>
		 * bittorrent - Struct which contains information retrieved from the .torrent (file). BitTorrent only. It contains following keys.
		 * <p>
		 * announceList - List of lists of announce URIs. If the torrent contains announce and no announce-list, announce is converted to the announce-list format.
		 * <p>
		 * comment - The comment of the torrent. comment.utf-8 is used if available.
		 * <p>
		 * creationDate - The creation time of the torrent. The value is an integer since the epoch, measured in seconds.
		 * <p>
		 * mode - File mode of the torrent. The value is either single or multi.
		 * <p>
		 * info - Struct which contains data from Info dictionary. It contains following keys.
		 * <p>
		 * name - name in info dictionary. name.utf-8 is used if available.
		 * <p>
		 * verifiedLength - The number of verified number of bytes while the files are being hash checked. This key exists only when this download is being hash checked.
		 * <p>
		 * verifyIntegrityPending - true if this download is waiting for the hash check in a queue. This key exists only when this download is in the queue.

		 * This method removes the URIs in delUris from and appends the URIs in addUris to download denoted by gid. delUris and addUris are lists of strings. A download can contain multiple files and URIs are attached to each file. fileIndex is used to select which file to remove/attach given URIs. fileIndex is 1-based. position is used to specify where URIs are inserted in the existing waiting URI list. position is 0-based. When position is omitted, URIs are appended to the back of the list. This method first executes the removal and then the addition. position is the position after URIs are removed, not the position when this method is called. When removing an URI, if the same URIs exist in download, only one of them is removed for each URI in delUris. In other words, if there are three URIs <a href="http://example.org/aria2">http://example.org/aria2</a> and you want remove them<a href=" all, you have to specif"> all, you have to specif</a>y (at least) 3 <a href="http://example.org/aria2">http://example.org/aria2</a> in delUris. This method returns a list which contains two integers. The first integer is the number of URIs deleted. The second integer is the number of URIs added.
